All file output will go to 'output' directory. This includes any scripts.

Create a file named 'users-google.csv'.

The file should represent a small slice of a software division within a 5000-employee company, including:

1. ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY:
   - Include C-Suite (CEO, COO, CPO, CTO).
   - 'Org Unit Path' must reflect the pod structure.
   - The root org unit is called fictum. C-Suite members will belong to the root.
   - Below fictum there are 3 org units: carthago, britannia, platform. These are children of fictum.
   - Include 3 distinct working pods (platform, carthago, britannia).
   - All employees will belong to one of these 4 organizational units.
   - Each pod must have a correct ratio of: 1 Product Manager, 1 Designer, 1 QA Engineer/Lead, 1 engineering manager, and 4-6 Software Engineers.
   - Include management chains up to C-Suite that have have pod leaders who report to directors and directors who report to VPs and VPs who report to C-Suite.
   - 1 TPM for this group of pods that reports to VP of director of engineering
   - Reporting is by function. Engineers report to engineers, product to product, etc.


2. DATA REQUIREMENTS:
   - Every manager mentioned must have their own corresponding employee row.
   - All 'Email Address' values must be unique and consistent with names.
   - Use UTF-8 with BOM for encoding.
   - the company is quadrigasoftware.com. Email addresses will end with this.
   - do not create phone numbers as they do not import correctly for Google users.
   - email names must be simple ASCII. No diacritics.

3. DIVERSITY & NAMES:
   - Do not use cute or celebrity names. Use realistic names. Do not use names from fiction.
   - Ensure a reasonable number of names are Western European (French, British, Spanish, Dutch, etc.) alongside African, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin American names.
   - At least one name should include and umlaut.

4. TECHNICAL FORMATTING:
   - Ensure 'Manager Email' is correctly populated for all non-CEO rows.
   - Set 'Change Password at Next Sign-In' to <blank>.
   - Set 'Employee Type' to 'Full-time'.
   - Include realistic Employee IDs, Cost Centers, and HQ Building locations.
   - 'floor' should just be a number
   - 'floor section' should be a combination of building, floor, desk number
   - Seat pods together for 'floor section'.
   - C-Suite should be a a different floor.

After creating csv generate an ascii text org chart in file org-chart-google.txt

Delete any scripts or other files that are generated.
